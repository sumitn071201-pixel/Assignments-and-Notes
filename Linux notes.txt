Great 👍 I went through your two uploaded notes. Let me break them down in a simpler way so you can clearly understand them.

---

## 1. `case-sac statement.txt`&#x20;

This is a **bash `case` statement** example.

```bash
Name="Girish"

case "$Name" in
    #case 1
    "Rajib") echo "Profession : Software Engineer" ;;
    
    #case 2
    "Vikas") echo "Profession : Web Developer" ;;
    
    #case 3
    "Girish") echo "Profession : Technical Content Writer" ;;
esac
```

### How it works:

* `Name="Girish"` → variable `Name` holds the value `"Girish"`.
* `case "$Name" in ... esac` → checks the value of `Name` against patterns.
* `"Rajib") ... ;;` → if `Name` is `"Rajib"`, it prints `"Profession : Software Engineer"`.
* `"Vikas") ... ;;` → if `Name` is `"Vikas"`, it prints `"Profession : Web Developer"`.
* `"Girish") ... ;;` → if `Name` is `"Girish"`, it prints `"Profession : Technical Content Writer"`.

👉 In this script, since `Name="Girish"`, the output will be:

```
Profession : Technical Content Writer
```

So basically:

* `case` works like a **switch-case** in C/Java.
* `;;` means "end of this case".
* `esac` is just `case` spelled backwards → used to close the block.

---

## 2. `Command line arguments.txt`&#x20;

This is about **special variables** in bash used for handling arguments.

### Example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Number of arguments passed: $#"
echo "Script name is $0"
echo "The 2nd argument passed is: $2"
echo "Arguments passed to script are: $*"
echo "Exit status of last command that executed: $?"
echo "Last argument provided to previous command: $_"
echo "PID of current shell is: $$"
echo "Flags set in the shell: $-"
```

### Explanation of special variables:

* `$0` → name of the script itself.
* `$1`, `$2`, ... → first, second, etc. arguments.
* `$#` → number of arguments passed.
* `$*` → all arguments as a single string.
* `$@` → all arguments but quoted separately.
* `$?` → exit status of last command (0 = success, non-0 = error).
* `$_` → last argument of previous command.
* `$$` → process ID (PID) of the current shell.
* `$-` → flags/options set in the shell.

### Example run:

If you save script as `test.sh` and run:

```bash
./test.sh hello world
```

Output will be:

```
Number of arguments passed: 2
Script name is ./test.sh
The 2nd argument passed is: world
Arguments passed to script are: hello world
Exit status of last command that executed: 0
Last argument provided to previous command: ./test.sh
PID of current shell is: 12345   # (changes each time)
Flags set in the shell: himBH
```

---

✅ So in short:

* **First file**: teaches you bash `case` statement.
* **Second file**: teaches you bash **command line arguments** & special variables.

---

Do you want me to also give you **a combined example script** that uses both `case` and command line arguments together (like choosing profession based on argument passed)?




Perfect 👍 Now you’ve uploaded two more notes. Let me carefully explain them in detail as well:

---

## 1. **`linux variables.txt`**&#x20;

This note is about **variables in Bash scripting**.

### 🔹 Defining Variables

```bash
num="1"
name="Devil"
```

* No spaces allowed around `=`.
* Variables are by default **strings** (text). Even numbers are stored as text unless explicitly used in arithmetic.

❌ Wrong: `variable_name = data`
✅ Correct: `variable_name=data`

---

### 🔹 Accessing Variables

```bash
VAR_1="Devil"
VAR_2="OWL"
echo "$VAR_1$VAR_2"
```

Output:

```
DevilOWL
```

👉 Always use `$` before variable name when accessing it.
👉 Quotes `""` are recommended to prevent word-splitting issues.

---

### 🔹 Unsetting Variables

```bash
var1="Devil"
var2=23
echo $var1 $var2   # Devil 23

unset var1         # deletes var1

echo $var1 $var2   # (empty) 23
```

* `unset` removes a variable completely.
* But it **cannot remove read-only variables**.

---

### 🔹 Read-only Variables

```bash
var1="Devil"
readonly var1
var1="Test"    # ERROR (cannot change)
```

* Once marked `readonly`, it cannot be modified or unset.

---

### 🔹 Combined Example

```bash
Var_name="Girish"
Var_age=25

# access
echo "Name is $Var_name, and age is $Var_age."

# read-only
var_blood_group="O-"
readonly var_blood_group
echo "Blood group is $var_blood_group and read only."
var_blood_group="B+"   # ERROR

# unset
unset Var_age
echo "After unsetting Var_age..."
echo "Name is $Var_name, blood group is $var_blood_group and age is $Var_age..."
```

✅ This demonstrates: normal use → read-only → unset.

---

## 2. **`linux conditions.txt`**&#x20;

This note is about **decision-making statements** in shell scripts.

### 🔹 1) `if-fi`

Simplest form.

```bash
Name="Girish"
if [ "$Name" = "Girish" ]; then
  echo "His name is Girish. It is true."
fi
```

* If condition is true → executes code.
* `[ "$Name" = "Girish" ]` → checks string equality.
* `fi` closes the `if` block (like `end if`).

---

### 🔹 2) `if-else-fi`

```bash
Age=17
if [ "$Age" -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You can vote"
else
    echo "You cannot vote"
fi
```

* `-ge` = greater than or equal.
* If `Age=17`, output: `"You cannot vote"`.

---

### 🔹 3) `if-elif-else-fi`

```bash
Age=17
if [ "$Age" -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You can vote"
elif [ "$Age" -eq 17 ]; then
    echo "You can vote after one year"
else
    echo "You cannot vote"
fi
```

* `elif` = else if.
* Handles multiple conditions.

---

### 🔹 4) Nested if-else

```bash
echo "Enter subject"
read subject

if [ $subject == 'Linux' ]
then
    echo "Enter Marks"
    read marks
    if [ $marks -ge 30 ]
    then
        echo "You passed"
    else
        echo "You failed"
    fi
else
    echo "Wrong Subject"
fi
```

👉 Steps:

1. Ask for subject.
2. If subject = Linux → ask for marks.
3. If marks ≥ 30 → passed, else failed.
4. If subject ≠ Linux → print "Wrong Subject".

---

## ✅ Quick Summary

* **Variables file** teaches:

  * Declaring (`var=value`), accessing (`$var`).
  * `unset` to remove.
  * `readonly` to lock variables.
* **Conditions file** teaches:

  * `if-fi` → single condition.
  * `if-else` → two paths.
  * `if-elif-else` → multiple paths.
  * Nested if → conditions inside conditions.

---

Would you like me to now **combine all four lessons** (variables + conditions + case + command-line arguments) into one **big example script** that demonstrates everything at once? That way you’ll see them working together in a real program.

Nice 👍 now you’ve uploaded **loops.txt** and **oprator.txt**. Let’s go through them in detail so you fully understand.

---

## 1. **`loops.txt`**&#x20;

This file explains different kinds of **loops** in shell scripting.

---

### 🔹 **While Loop**

```bash
a=0
while [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
  echo $a
  a=`expr $a + 1`
done
```

* `while [ condition ]` → repeats as long as condition is **true**.
* Here, `$a -lt 10` means "while a is less than 10".
* Each time, `a` is incremented by 1 (`expr` is used for arithmetic).

👉 Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

---

### 🔹 **Until Loop**

```bash
a=0
until [ $a -gt 10 ]
do
  echo $a
  a=`expr $a + 1`
done
```

* Opposite of `while`.
* Runs until condition becomes **true**.
* So loop continues **while condition is false**.

---

### 🔹 **For Loop with `break`**

```bash
for a in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
  if [ $a == 5 ]
  then
    break
  fi
  echo "Iteration no $a"
done
```

* Loops through values `1..10`.
* When `a==5`, `break` stops the loop immediately.

👉 Output:

```
Iteration no 1
Iteration no 2
Iteration no 3
Iteration no 4
```

---

### 🔹 **For Loop with `continue`**

```bash
for a in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
  if [ $a == 5 ]
  then
    continue
  fi
  echo "Iteration no $a"
done
```

* Same loop, but `continue` skips that iteration only.
* When `a==5`, it skips printing but continues loop.

👉 Output:

```
Iteration no 1
Iteration no 2
Iteration no 3
Iteration no 4
Iteration no 6
Iteration no 7
Iteration no 8
Iteration no 9
Iteration no 10
```

---

### 🔹 **Infinite Loop**

```bash
while true
do
  echo "Hi, I am infinity loop"
  sleep 1
done
```

* Runs forever because `true` always succeeds.
* `sleep 1` pauses 1 second each loop.

👉 Output (keeps repeating):

```
Hi, I am infinity loop
Hi, I am infinity loop
...
```

---

## 2. **`oprator.txt`**&#x20;

This file explains **operators in shell scripting**.

---

### 🔹 **String Operators**

```bash
# ==
if [ 'Girish' == 'Girish' ]; then echo "same"; fi
# → Output: same

# !=
if [ 'Girish' != 'Apple' ]; then echo "not same"; fi
# → Output: not same

# -n (string is not null)
if [ -n "Girish" ]; then echo "not null"; fi
# → Output: not null

# -z (string is null)
if [ -z "Girish" ]; then echo "null"; else echo "not null"; fi
# → Output: not null
```

---

### 🔹 **Arithmetic Comparison Operators**

```bash
# -eq (equal)
if [ 10 -eq 10 ]; then echo "Equal"; fi

# -ge (greater or equal)
if [ 10 -ge 9 ]; then echo "Greater or equal"; fi

# -gt (greater than)
if [ 10 -gt 8 ]; then echo "Greater"; fi

# -le (less or equal)
if [ 10 -le 12 ]; then echo "Less than or equal"; fi

# -lt (less than)
if [ 10 -lt 13 ]; then echo "Less than"; fi

# -ne (not equal)
if [ 10 -ne 13 ]; then echo "Not Equal"; fi
```

👉 Output will be:

```
Equal
Greater or equal
Greater
Less than or equal
Less than
Not Equal
```

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Loops file:** teaches you looping (`while`, `until`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, infinite loops).
* **Operators file:** teaches you **string** (`==, !=, -n, -z`) and **numeric** (`-eq, -ne, -lt, -gt, -le, -ge`) operators.

---

Would you like me to now make you a **sample script that combines operators + loops** (like looping through numbers and checking conditions with operators)?
